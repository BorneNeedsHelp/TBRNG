-BASE- TBRNG (Time Based Random Number Generator) is a module which generates random numbers based on the time module.
-BASE- There are 10 functions:

TBRNG_Binary (Generates a random integer in binary)
TBRNG (Generates a random decimal)
TBRNG_Sort (Uses times_to_recurculate to repeat the random process then sorts them)
TBRNG_Int (Generates a random integer)
TBRNG_Double (Generates a random number then, generates another random number using the returned number)
TBRNG_Average (Uses times_to_recurculate to generate random numbers, then averages them)
TBRNG_Statistics (Uses times_to_recurculate to generate a random number then lists them)
TBRNG_Guass (Generates a random number for the real part, then generates a random number using the real part for the fake part {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(disambiguation)})
TBRNG_Int_Range (Uses times_to_recurculate to generate a random integer)

This took me 2 days ;)
